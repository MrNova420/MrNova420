Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a passionate developer focused on building robust, innovative solutions. Most of my work is still in progress, but I'm dedicated to refining and completing projects that make a difference.

## 🚀 Main Project: NovaShieldV2

**NovaShieldV2** is now my flagship project—actively developed, stable, and soon to be my first fully completed repository!  
> **Note:** The original NovaShield repo will be deprecated and deleted soon. After that, **NovaShieldV2 will be renamed to just NovaShield** and will be the only maintained version going forward.

**Why NovaShieldV2?**  
- Security-driven, reliable, and built with best practices  
- Designed for stability but always open to new ideas and improvements  
- Welcoming collaboration, suggestions, and contributions!

## 🛠️ What's Next?

After NovaShieldV2, I’ll be turning my attention to **Nova Auto Versus Miner**—aiming for a full, feature-rich release.  
Most of my repos are “in development”—I believe in continuous improvement and sharing work early so others can learn, use, and contribute.

## 💡 How I Operate

- **Open Source First:** I encourage everyone to use, fork, and contribute to my projects.
- **Continuous Development:** No repo is ever truly “done”—expect frequent updates!
- **Community Driven:** Feedback and pull requests are always welcome.
